# Single screen Android app for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree

The task was to build a simple, single screen Android app.  I chose to do a business card of one of my favorite cafes, Oso Negro, in Nelson, BC.

I found two images online for the app.  One is of the interior of the cafe, and the other is their logo.

I had a hard time figuring out how to make all the elements responsive, and to make it look somewhat good.  I'm still not fully happy with how it looks.  I don't know enough about XML design to implement some of the design I had in mind.  For instance, I'd like to make the text look better.
